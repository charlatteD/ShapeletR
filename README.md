# ShapeletR

This repository contains two R files:

1. ShapeletFunc: Functions that search for and evaluate shapelets 
2. Example: Example code to simulate time series with unique shapes and run the shapelet analysis 

which are the codes for the paper "Shapelet-based time-series classification for relating daily asthma control to highly time-resolved residential indoor PM2.5 measurements".
